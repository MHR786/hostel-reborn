Project Context: I am re-engineering a legacy PHP "Hostel Management System" into a modern full-stack application. Stack: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Prisma ORM, and SQLite (for local dev). Goal: Replicate the specific modules from the legacy system (shown in screenshots) but with modern architecture and RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).

1. Data Model (Schema Engineering)
Create a schema.prisma that supports the full legacy feature set. The schema must include:

User & Auth: User model with name, email, password (hashed), image, and role (SUPER_ADMIN, ADMIN, EMPLOYEE, STUDENT).

Hostel Infrastructure:

Block: Represents buildings (e.g., Block A, Block B).

Room: Linked to Block. Has roomNumber, capacity, type (AC/Non-AC).

SeatAllocation: One-to-one link between Student and Room.

Financials (Legacy Replication):

StudentPayment: Tracks fees. Must include status (PENDING, APPROVED) to support the "Approval List" workflow.

VendorPayment: Payment records to external suppliers.

Expense: For general "Bill Manage" and "Cost Manage".

Salary: Records of employee payroll payments (Month, Amount, Date).

Mess Management:

MealRate: Configurable daily/monthly rates.

MealRecord: Tracks daily meals (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner) per student.

Communication & Ops:

Notice: Title, content, date, visibility.

Complaint: Student issues with status workflow.

Attendance: Tracks daily presence for Students and Employees.

System Settings:

SystemConfig: Singleton or Key-Value store for global settings (e.g., Hostel Name, Currency, Time Sets/Curfew times).

2. Authentication & Roles
Login Flow: /login page that redirects based on role.

Middleware: strict protection for Admin vs. Student routes.

Seed Data (IMPORTANT): Please create a seed script (seed.ts) that populates the database with these exact users so I can test immediately:

Admin: admin@hms.com / admin123

Student: student@hms.com / student123

3. Admin Dashboard (Full Legacy Migration)
Implement a responsive Sidebar layout with the following specific modules (matching the legacy menus):

A. Dashboard Home

Stats Cards: Total Employees, Current Students, Total Rooms, Today's Meals.

Widgets: "Top 4 Notices" and a Calendar view.

B. Student Management

Admission: Form to add students with photo upload.

Seat Allocation: Interface to assign students to Blocks/Rooms.

Student List: Searchable table of all students.

C. Financial Management (Consolidated)

Students Payment:

Add Payment: Form to record fees.

Approval List: A view for Admins to verify/approve pending online payments or drafts.

Vendor Payment: CRUD for payments to vendors.

Bill & Cost Manage: CRUD for operational expenses (Electricity, Internet, Repairs).

D. Employee & Payroll

Employee Manage: Add/Edit staff details.

Salary: Two views: "Salary Add" (Issue payment) and "Salary View" (History).

E. Mess & Attendance

Meal Manage: Bulk interface to mark meals for students for the day.

Attendance: Calendar-based interface to mark Present/Absent for students/staff.

F. System Administration

Notice Board: CRUD interface. Admins create notices; Students view them.

Settings / Setup:

Blocks: Manage building names.

Fees & Meal Rate: Set global prices.

Time Set: Configure hostel timings/shifts.

4. Student Dashboard Features
My Profile: View allocated Room, Block, and Bed.

Notice Board: Read-only view of active notices.

Payment History: View paid fees and outstanding dues.

Complaints: Submit new complaints and track status.

5. UI/UX Guidelines
Design System: Use Tailwind CSS. Professional "Admin Panel" aesthetic (Blue/White/Gray palette).

Components: Use Lucide React icons.

Responsiveness: The Sidebar must be collapsible on mobile. Tables must scroll horizontally on small screens.
